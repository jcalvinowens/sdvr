/**
 * Key Exchange Procotol
 * ---------------------
 *
 * The protocol is structured so that the daemon can maintain zero state for
 * DGRAM clients until the client can be authenticated.
 *
 * The padding in msg_0 exists to make the daemon an uneconomical reflector:
 * since the source address could be spoofed, we force the client to send more
 * data than we reply with.
 *
 * The implementation provides perfect forward security: a third party who is
 * able to record all network traffic from a client, and later compromise that
 * client and obtain its secret keys, will not be able to decrypt any of the
 * recorded data.
